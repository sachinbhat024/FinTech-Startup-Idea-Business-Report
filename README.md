# FinTech-Startup-Business-Plan-Report

I have 
developed and established a business plan for a FinTech startup (fictitious) targeting the Australian market. For tackling this task, the venture **MelPay** draws its 
inspiration from the extremely successful Indian FinTech startup Pine Labs, and it would 
adapt its offerings to cater to the distinctive needs and regulatory landscape of Australia.
