# MelPay: Empowering Australian SMBs with Seamless Payment Solutions

I have 
developed and established a business plan for a FinTech startup (fictitious) targeting the Australian market. For tackling this task, the venture **MelPay** draws its 
inspiration from the extremely successful Indian FinTech startup **Pine Labs**, and it would 
adapt its offerings to cater to the distinctive needs and regulatory landscape of Australia.  

## The Problem
Many Australian SMBs are stuck using outdated payment systems that result in inefficiencies, high transaction fees, and a lack of access to modern financial tools. This makes it difficult for them to keep up with changing customer expectations like contactless payments and integrated e-commerce experiences.
